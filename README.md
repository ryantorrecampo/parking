input2.txt - Shows that a car can only be in one place at a time.

input3.txt - Shows that if a car tries to exit even if it already has, nothing will happen since the car cannot be found in any of the parking lots.

input4.txt - Shows that a car will wait when both lots are fully occupied.

input5.txt - Shows an example of a "free garage" where cars of any type can park without being charged.
